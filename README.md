# 18.337 Course Project Template
Click "Use this template" to get a quick start on the semester project layout and formatting.

This template repository contains:
 - basic directory structure
 - blank journal-styled paper to use for your proposal and eventual paper
 - GitHub action that will auto-magically render your `paper/paper.md` file into a nice looking PDF and attach it as an artifact to the GitHub action runner ([like this](https://github.com/JacksonBurns/18337-project-template/actions/runs/4494008366))

Happy Coding!
